# Google Sheets | Dashbord/Live

I tried in this project to build an application similar to Twitter but certainly does 
not have all the features, but it contains the basic features such as (create an account, 
add a tweet, add a friend, like, comment, etc..).

### 2- Frontend:
    - using 'React.js' to build the frontend of Twirrer.
    - using 'React Hooks' to handle local state & 'React Context api' to handle global state in the app.
    - using 'Axios' to execute all RestFull api requests in the app.
